# Senior Design Project
Electrical Engineering Senior Design Project at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, 2020

The purpose of this project portion is to read IMU sensor data from individual wing segments, process it, and then send it to the Pixhawk flight controller.

## Getting Started
This project was created using the Arduino IDE.

### Dependencies
Multiple libraries were used and adapted to fit this project's needs.

IMU Libraries
* Adafruit_BNO055
* Adafruit_LSM9DS1
* Adafruit_FXOS8700
* Adafruit_FXAS21002C
* Adafruit_AHRS

CAN Libraries
* canard (adapted from libcanard)
* canard_avr (adapted from libcanard)
* can (adapted from libcanard)

## Implementation
