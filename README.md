# Senior Design Project
Electrical Engineering Senior Design Project at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, 2020

The purpose of this project portion is to read IMU sensor data from individual wing segments, process it, and then send it to the Pixhawk flight controller over CAN.

## Getting Started
This project was created using the Arduino IDE for the AST-CAN485 development board.

### Dependencies
Multiple third-party libraries were used and adapted to fit this project's needs.

IMU Libraries
* Adafruit_BNO055
* Adafruit_LSM9DS1
* Adafruit_FXOS8700
* Adafruit_FXAS21002C
* Adafruit_AHRS

CAN Libraries
* libcanard

## Implementation
