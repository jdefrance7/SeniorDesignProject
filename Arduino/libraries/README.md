# Libraries

Multiple third-party libraries were implemented in various degrees throughout the projects. 

A number of custom libraries were written to interface between these libraries and are described below.

---

### LED

A simple LED class for hardware debugging.

---

### BNO055

Provides standardized IMU functions for interfacing with the BNO055.

---

### LSM9DS1

Provides standardized IMU functions for interfacing with the LSM9DS1.

---

### NXP_FXOS_FXAS

Provides standardized IMU functions for interfacing with the NXP_FXOS_FXAS.

---

### Quaternions

Provides example functions for computing the angles between quaternions.

---

### AST_CAN_v0

CAN driver using ASTCanLib for UAVCAN v0 (legacy).

---

### AST_CAN_v1

CAN driver using ASTCanLib for UAVCAN v1.

---

### AVR_CAN_v0

CAN driver using Canard AVR for UAVCAN v0.

---

### Libcanard_v0

Libcanard v0 source code files (legacy).

---

### Libcanard_v1

Libcanard v1 source code files.

---

### UAVCAN_v0

UAVCAN v0 data type encoding, decoding, and debugging (legacy).

---

### UAVCAN_v1
