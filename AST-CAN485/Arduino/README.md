# Arduino

In addition to the `wing_segment_v0` project sketch, multiple sub-projects were created to test various other aspects associated with the overall project.

Brief descriptions of the main project and supporting sketches are included below.

## Libraries

Please note that the `libraries` folder is not itself a project sketch but rather contains the source code for libraries used throughout the project. 

Read the `libraries` documentation to learn more about the custom libraries developed for this project.
